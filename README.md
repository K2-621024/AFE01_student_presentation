# AFE01 Student Presentation

## 📌 Overview

This project was created as part of a graduate course titled **Advanced Financial Engineering**. The main objective is to analyze and evaluate the pricing of a structured financial product described in the following brochure:

> [Investec FNIB03 Rand Nikkei 225 Autocall Product Brochure](https://www.investec.com/content/dam/south-africa/intermediaries/invest/autocall/Investec%20FNIB03%20Rand%20Nikkei%20225%20Autocall%20Brochure%20and%20App%20Form.pdf)

We aim to compare two numerical methods for pricing this product:

- **Monte Carlo simulation**
- **Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation**

## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook
